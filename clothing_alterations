/** In this project, Khan Academy created a database of clothes, then decided they need a price column. I used ALTER to add a 'price' column to the 
table. Then I selected all the columns in each row to see what my table looks like. Next I assigned each item a price, using UPDATE - item 1 should be 10
dollars, item 2 should be 20 dollars, item 3 should be 30 dollars. Then I used another SELECT of all the rows to check that it worked as expected. Last,
I inserted a new item into the table that has all three attributes filled in, including 'price'. I did one final SELECT of all the rows to check it
worked. **/

    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,

SELECT * FROM clothes;

INSERT INTO clothes (type, design, price)
